Hi, I'm Aditya Chindhade, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science and I'm currently working with Prof. Nick Sahinidis on an Automated Machine Learning technique known as ALAMO. The goal of my research is compare group-sparse lasso and group lasso with ALAMO for feature selection. Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon, I was an undergraduate at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS-Pilani). Additionally, I was a research intern at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Harvard HST division in Cambridge, where I worked on developing a predictive model for drug release using spectroscopy data.
